						All purchases made through the Website are processed by a third party

						Paddle or its collection or use of information. Any questions or concerns
						about Paddleâ€™s practices should be directed to Paddle. Paddle provides us
						with certain non-personal information relating to purchases made by
						visitors to the Website. The non-personal information may include details

						non-personal purchase information may be linked to the Personal

						Managing Personal Information

					<p className="text-gray-600 text-sm leading-6 mb-2">
						You are able to update your Personal Information in your "Account
						Settings" on the Website. Currently this is limited to just your email
						address, as described above. You may also request that we delete your
						email address, but this will prevent you from accessing the products you
						have purchased from Tailwind. When you update information, we may maintain
						a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Some information may
						remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your
						account for a retention period. Once the retention period expires,
						Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
						right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your
						information cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
						period. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply
						with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
						We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
						Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would
						identify you personally.

						Use and Processing of Collected Information

						Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your
						experience; improve our Website; improve customer service; process
						transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders,
						updates, etc; and operate our Website. Non-Personal Information collected
						is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
						statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical
						information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify
						any particular user of the system. We may process Personal Information
						related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given their
						consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some
						legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to
						such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any
						other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply,
						whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European
						data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the
						performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
						obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a
						legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a
						task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
						official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the
						purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In
						any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that
						applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
						Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
						necessary to enter into a contract.
